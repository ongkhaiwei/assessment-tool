<#--How the quantitative estimates are used to quantify the performance against the business objective?-->

<div>
    True positives (successful loans) generate revenue for the FSI and credit for the loan applicant, and true negatives (correct declines) reduce loan losses for the FSI and may preserve the credit rating of applicants by avoiding later defaults. Therefore, the business objective is served by taking both into account.
</div>

<div>
    False negatives (incorrect declines) deny credit to applicants. As some groups may already face challenges with accessing credit, it is important to take the false negative rate into account to align with the social objective of increasing access to credit, and the social constraint of avoiding increasing disadvantage.
