<#--What is the tradeoff between model performance and fairness?-->
<div>
The threshold for loan approval will affect the fairness metrics. When varying the threshold, the value of fairness
metrics would also change. We could also use separate thresholds for different groups of applicants. A grid search can
be conducted for different thresholds. We can visualize the fairness-performance tradeoffs (if applicable) of operating the model at
various lending risk threshold settings.
