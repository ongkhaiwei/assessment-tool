<#--How the model outputs is used to achieve the systemâ€™s objectives?-->

<div>
    A credit scoring model is used to predict the likelihood of default for a customer. The definition of default
    depends on the actual business scenario. The model outputs a probability between 0 and 1 for each customer, which
    represents the risk of default. Zero indicates the highest risk of default, while 1 indicates the lowest risk of
    default. Applicants with a default probability above a chosen threshold will be approved.
